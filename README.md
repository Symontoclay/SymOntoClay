<div><div><p>
SymOntoClay is a Domain-specific scripting language for creating game artificial intelligence (game AI).
</p>

The main idea of the language to combine imperative dynamically typed C-like language with non-mainstream approaches:
* logic programming
* fuzzy logic
* multiple fuzzy inheritance
* and other interesting approaches.

<p>
Also SymOntoClay is a game AI engine which executes SymOntoClay language scripts in game.
It is implemented as open source components for Unity.

## Goals
<div><div><h3 class='center-h' is-processed="true">
Short term goal
</h3>

<p>
The current goal of the project is experimenting on using different symbolic artificial intelligence approaches in game development.
First of all It's logic programming, fuzzy logic, fuzzy inheritance and natural language processing (NLP).
</p>

<p>
I think symbolic logic will help to do indie-game developing better.
There are many interesting things in symbolic artificial intelligence approaches.
And It is very interesting for me to use and see them in gaming.
</p>

<h3 class='center-h' is-processed="true">
Long term goal
</h3>

<p>
I hope that SymOntoClay will become a powerful and useful tool for game development in the future.
I will be very glad If It helps to increase amount of cool games, happy users and game developers.
</p>

<p>
I will continue development so that this future comes faster.

</div>

## Domain-specific language (DSL)
<div><div><p>
SymOntoClay engine has own Domain-specific scripting language (DSL).
</p>

It is a imperative scripting dynamically typed C-like language which combines with non-mainstream approaches:
* logic programming
* fuzzy logic
* multiple fuzzy inheritance
* and other interesting approaches.

<p>
I'm completely free in my experiments with syntax.
</p>

<p>
My main criterion in SymOntoClay syntax solutions is the most elegant inclusion of interesting features in the syntax and the convenience of using them in game development.
</p>

<p>
Custom domain-specific language allows to combine features in more convenient way for using.
It could be difficult or even impossible to add non-mainstream approaches into existing programming language.
</p>
</div></div>

## Project status
<div><div><p>
I've making SymOntoClay alone in my free time since 2016. 
So It's not fast.
</p>

<p>
I've made two prototypes: first implementation of domain-specific language and integration with Unity3D.
I've posted the second prototype's demo-video into an Indie game developers group on Facebook. 
You can see this demo <i class="fab fa-facebook" title="Facebook"></i><a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndieGameDevs/permalink/10155707420791573/'>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm focusing on key features (the interesting features from AI). 
Other features is being added only for support working or demonstrating the key features.
So there can be absent necessary for practical using  but non key features on the DSL or engine.
Also stability and performance are not in focus - I don't have time for these sides while key features have not been implemented.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to continue my experiments.
And I hope this project will become useful for many indie game developers in the future.

## Contributing
<div><div><p>
SymOntoClay is still under development. 
I will be glad if someone else is interested in it.
Contributions are always welcome!
</p>

<p>
Any help testing the software, reporting or fixing bugs, reviewing pull requests and recent changes, writing tests, or helping with outstanding issues is very welcome. 
Implementing new features, or improving/refactoring the codebase, is of course also welcome, but to avoid wasted effort, especially for larger changes, I encourage discussing these on the <a href='https://github.com/Symontoclay/SymOntoClay/issues'>issue tracker</a> or <a href='https://github.com/Symontoclay/SymOntoClay/discussions'>Discussion</a> first.
</p>
