# Contributing
<p>
SymOntoClay is still under development. 
I will be glad if someone else is interested in it.
Contributions are always welcome!
</p>

<p>
Any help testing the software, reporting or fixing bugs, reviewing pull requests and recent changes, writing tests, or helping with outstanding issues is very welcome. 
Implementing new features, or improving/refactoring the codebase, is of course also welcome, but to avoid wasted effort, especially for larger changes, I encourage discussing these on the <a href='https://github.com/Symontoclay/SymOntoClay/issues'>issue tracker</a> or <a href='https://github.com/Symontoclay/SymOntoClay/discussions'>Discussion</a> first.

Please follow the <a href='/dev/contributing.html'>Developers Guide</a> if you want to help
