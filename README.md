## Installation and using
Now I am going to complete proof of concept stage of the project.
So firstly the project is very unstable.
And secondly It doesn't have enough features for using.

In the future I am going to make installator but now I am concentrating on making features for proof of concept and MVP.

You can build the project from source code.

Fell free to contact me about the project.
